This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges from all years. 

Currently, I'm working on both 2024 and 2015. I'll try to use different programming languages for each year. For 2024, I’m using [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) and possibly [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as the challenge progresses. For 2015, I’m using [Python](https://www.python.org/). 

Please note that the _comments_ in the code reflect my thought process while developing the solutions for each day.

## Progress

The table below shows my progress for each year:

| Year | Language | Stars Earned            |
| :--: | :------: | :----------:            |
| 2024 | Perl     | :star2: 40/50 :star2:   |
| 2015 | Python   | :star2: 08/50 :star2:   |


## Input Files

The input files for my solutions are stored in each day's folder. However, all my solutions are designed to work with any valid inputs. Feel free to grab your own inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website and try them out!
