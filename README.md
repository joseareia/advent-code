This repository contains my entries for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), implemented primarily in [Perl](https://www.perl.org/). I may also explore solutions in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as the challenge progresses.

The calendar idea was inspired by [@anamsmartins](https://github.com/anamsmartins/adventOfCode2024) :heart:

## Input Files

The actual input files for my entries are stored in a submodule that points to a private repository and are not included here. However, all my solutions are designed to work with any valid inputs. Feel free to grab your own inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website and try them out!
