This directory contains my entries for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), implemented primarily in [Perl](https://www.perl.org/). I may also explore solutions in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as the challenge progresses. Please note that the _comments_ in the code reflect my thought process while developing the solutions for each corresponding day.

## Input Files

The input files for my entries are stored in each day's folder. However, all my solutions are designed to work with any valid inputs. Feel free to grab your own inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website and try them out!
